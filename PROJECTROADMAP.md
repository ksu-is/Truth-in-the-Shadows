# Project Roadmap

## Sprint 1
- [x] Approved project topic
- [x] Established GitHub account and joined KSU-IS organization
- [x] Establish ownership of a code repository
- [x] Edited and committed changes in readme.md file
- [x] Explored at least one existing Python code related to the project
- [makeuseofcode/python-adventure](https://github.com/makeuseofcode/python-adventure-game)
- [x] Update projectroadmap.md file and explain findings from existing Python code related to the project.
### My Findings in Python Adventure Game (Existing)
Text-based Combat against enemies (Fight/Flee, Use of Items, Success/Defeat). My project will not have a combat system, but my project will have an item inventory and interaction system, where players can use items that they have, and can use them while interacting with NPCs or equipment that may need the use of an item. 
- Players can walk around (Forward/Backward, Left/Right). My project will have this walking system as well. 
- Introduction Scene. This is very important for my project because there is a backstory.
- Name Input. I will add this to make the players' character seem more personal.
- [x] Read the existing Python code base related to the project and attempt to run it.
- After reading and running the Python code base related to the project, it works well. For my project, I will be adding an inventory system, which will not be used in just the combat system, but also to interact with NPCs or equipment that may need the use of an item.
